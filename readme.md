# Stencil Component Starter

This is a starter project for building a standalone Web Component using Stencil.

# Stencil

Stencil is a compiler for building fast web apps using Web Components.

Stencil components are just Web Components, so they work in any major framework or with no framework at all.

## Getting Started

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm start
```

To build the component for production, run:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

To run the unit tests for the components, run:

```bash
pnpm test
```

## Naming Components

Components should be prefaced with `viz` such as `<viz-header>`.

## Using this component

### Lazy Loading

If your Stencil project is built with the [`dist`](https://stenciljs.com/docs/distribution) output target, you can import a small bootstrap script that registers all components and allows you to load individual component scripts lazily.

For example, given your Stencil project namespace is called `my-design-system`, to use `my-component` on any website, inject this into your HTML:

```html
<script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/my-design-system"></script>
<!--
To avoid unpkg.com redirects to the actual file, you can also directly import:
https://unpkg.com/foobar-design-system@0.0.1/dist/foobar-design-system/foobar-design-system.esm.js
-->
<my-component first="Stencil" last="'Don't call me a framework' JS"></my-component>
```

This will only load the necessary scripts needed to render `<my-component />`. Once more components of this package are used, they will automatically be loaded lazily.

You can also import the script as part of your `node_modules` in your applications entry file:

```tsx
import 'foobar-design-system/dist/foobar-design-system/foobar-design-system.esm.js';
```

### Standalone

If you are using a Stencil component library with `dist-custom-elements`, we recommend importing Stencil components individually in those files where they are needed.

To export Stencil components as standalone components make sure you have the [`dist-custom-elements`](https://stenciljs.com/docs/custom-elements) output target defined in your `stencil.config.ts`.

For example, given you'd like to use `<my-component />` as part of a React component, you can import the component directly via:

```tsx
import 'foobar-design-system/my-component';

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <div>
        <my-component first="Stencil" last="'Don't call me a framework' JS"></my-component>
      </div>
    </>
  );
}

export default App;
```
